This is a quick program made to automate the input of airfoil profiles into CAD programs. 

At the moment, the program recieves a .txt fil with all the coordinates of the airfoil (airfoiltools for example), and the user can set the angles, position and chord of the airfoil. 

The Centroid of the airfoil is also calculated, so during development you can have a good reference point. 

For the future I intend to add "macros" to this code, soi it can auto upadate de CAD software with all the airfoils.
